Hosting In GitHub Pages

    Create a GitHub Repository: Open GitHub Desktop and click on “File > New Repository”. Fill in the necessary details like the repository name, description, and local path. Click “Create Repository”.

    Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code: Once the repository is created, click “Open in Visual Studio Code” in GitHub Desktop. This will allow you to start editing files in VS Code.

    Insert any web-appropriate files: Start by selecting one of your Open Processing projects, and download the complete project. Maake sure to unzip the files before moving them into the repository.

    Commit and Push Changes: Go back to GitHub Desktop, and you should see the new files you created. Write a commit message like “First P5 site.”

    Initialize GitHub Pages: Go to your repository on GitHub.com. Click on the “Settings” tab, scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section, and select the branch you want to use (usually main or master). Then select the root folder for the source. Save the settings, and GitHub will provide a link to view your site live.
