## Modeling Spatial Data

Let's gather some sample data & organize it in a manner that suits a spatial project.

1.	Choose one of these [radio directories](https://archive.org/search?query=subject%3A%22Radio-Directories%22) 
2.	Decide which locations found in the source are mappable
3.	Decide what information might be associated with the locations
4.	Re(name) your columns in your table
5.	Fill in the table with +/- 10 rows (don't worry about latitude / longitude pairs at first) 
6.	You can try Geocode by Awesome Table (under Extensions)
