## Recogito Overview

Letâ€™s create our first map starting from a text (or image!) using Recogito and Kepler.gl.

1.	Log into [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/) and upload your chosen document (PDF, JPG, or plain text).
2.	Annotate places making sure they are error-free. You can also collaborate on the same project / file.
3.	Export to CSV file.
4.	Upload the CSV file to [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) and play around with the map styles.
