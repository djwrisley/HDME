## Preparation for Humanities Data and Mapping Environments

#### [European Summer University in Digital Humanities](https://esudh.github.io/)
#### Université Marie et Louis Pasteur, Besançon, France 
#### 21.7-2.8.2025

### 1. Requisite Devices

We assume for the workshop that participants will be able to bring their own **laptop** with relatively new updates to operating systems. We will work with some web-based resources as well as a download of the long-term release (LTR) version of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) Specs for computers are described for all systems in the above link. Generally speaking, a tablet may be sufficient for some lessons, but is not sufficient for QGIS.

As we will be doing some data collection in the city, it will also be beneficial to have a **smartphone with a camera**. We will leverage location services in order to geotag our images. It is usually under Settings > Location or Privacy > Location. Information about activating location services can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epM12HxNx2g) for iOS and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8p1SftNGTE) for Android. If you have a Chinese phone (Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo, etc) it may be called "location information," "positioning," or "GPS settings."

> _In the case that a student does not have a smartphone or a laptop that can run QGIS, we may be able to devise a work around, e.g. working in pairs or manually geocoding. There will only be a few sessions featuring these devices._

### 2. Make accounts at the following

| service | usage | notes |
| Google | for access to drive for some file sharing | perhaps can forego, with reduced functionality | 
| [Posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans) | sharing of R Markdown files and running code | Choose the free account |
| [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) | edit access to OSM editing and login for UMap | |  
| [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount) | edit access | it needs to be a different account from Wikimedia Commons, if you have one there | 
| [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) | for Github pages, hosting web maps | If you already have a GitHub account, there is no need to make another one. If you have your own web hosting, you can use that | 
| [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/) | for group annotation | |
| [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/user/register) | for HDME bibliography | optional, unless you want to join the group | 
| [openai.com](https://openai.com/) | for debugging and some code generation | optional, other genAI interfaces are possible | 

### 3. Downloads

| software | usage | notes |
| [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) | for management of files on GitHub | if fluent in git in terminal, not necessary | 
| [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) | an easy to use text editor for editing files locally | if you already use another text editor such as Visual Studio Code, you do not need Sublime. The examples we will use in the workshop will be done in Sublime. |
| [QGIS](https://qgis.org/download/) | Open source GIS standalone software | Don't download the regular version, but instead the Long Term Version 3.40.8 'Bratislava.' Mac users will need to heed the "tips for first launch." | 
| [Tropy](https://tropy.org/) | a CMS for photos | |
