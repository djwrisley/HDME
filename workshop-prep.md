## Preparation for Humanities Data and Mapping Environments

#### [European Summer University in Digital Humanities](https://esudh.github.io/)
#### Université Marie et Louis Pasteur, Besançon, France 
#### 21.7-2.8.2025

### Devices

We assume for the workshop that participants will be able to bring their own **laptop** with relatively new updates to operating systems. We will work with some web-based resources as well as a download of the long-term release (LTR) version of [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) Specs for computers are described for all systems in the above link. Generally speaking, a tablet may be sufficient for some lessons, but is not sufficient for QGIS.

As we will be doing some data collection in the city, it will also be beneficial to have a **smartphone with a camera**. We will leverage location services in order to geotag our images. It is usually under Settings > Location or Privacy > Location. Information about activating location services can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epM12HxNx2g) for iOS and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8p1SftNGTE) for Android. If you have a Chinese phone (Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo, etc) it may be called "location information," "positioning," or "GPS settings."

> _In the case that a student does not have a smartphone or a laptop that can run QGIS, we may be able to devise a work around, e.g. working in pairs or manually geocoding. There will only be a few sessions featuring these devices._
